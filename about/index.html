    <h1>About E3B</h1>

    <p>The Army E3B test is a rigorous assessment that evaluates a soldier's proficiency in basic combat skills, physical fitness, and medical knowledge. It is designed to test soldiers on their ability to perform under pressure and demonstrate their expertise in a variety of combat scenarios. The E3B test is a challenging but rewarding experience that can help soldiers develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the Army.</p>

    <p>The E3B is divided into three components:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB)</b>,</li>
            <li><b>Expert Soldier Badge (ESB)</b>,</li>
            <li><b>Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB)</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Each of these badges has its own set of requirements that soldiers must meet in order to earn the badge. </p>
            
        <p>The EIB and ESB tests soldiers on their physical fitness, land navigation, individual soldier skills, and tactical movement. The EIB is for 11-series and 18-series soldiers, while the ESB is for soldiers not 11-series or 18-series.</p>
                
        <p>The EFMB tests soldiers on their medical knowledge and their ability to provide care to casualties in a combat environment. The EFMB is for 68-series soldiers.</p>

        <br>
