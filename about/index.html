    <h1>About E3B</h1>

    <p>The Army E3B test is a rigorous assessment that evaluates a soldier's proficiency in basic combat skills, physical fitness, and medical knowledge. It is designed to test soldiers on their ability to perform under pressure and demonstrate their expertise in a variety of combat scenarios. The E3B test is a challenging but rewarding experience that can help soldiers develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the Army.</p>

    <p>The E3B test is divided into three main components:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Expert Infantryman Badge (EIB)</b>,</li>
            <li><b>Expert Soldier Badge (ESB)</b>,</li>
            <li><b>Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB)</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Each of these badges has its own set of requirements that soldiers must meet in order to earn the badge. The EIB tests soldiers on their basic combat skills, such as marksmanship, land navigation, and tactical movement. The ESB tests soldiers on their physical fitness and their ability to perform under stress. The EFMB tests soldiers on their medical knowledge and their ability to provide care to casualties in a combat environment.</p>
